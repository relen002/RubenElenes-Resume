        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Ruben Elenes and this Resume is going to shine a light into my goals and personal life. I am an only child that was born into two hard working parents who have given me all the tools I need to succeed. Currently I am on the path to succession as I am attending a four year university. I know that the path to achieve greatness will not be easy but I am willing to push through and give it all I got. The foundation of my entire life is being set upon these 4 years and my goals are going to be achieved regardless of the problems I encounter. My dreams of being a biochemist are set and they will soon stop being only dreams. My life will not be wasted as I know for a fact I will achieve greatness and I won’t stop until I do.<br><br>
        As a biochemistry major I want to help people all over the world. My goals are to one day make a pharmaceutical company where I can make it cheaper for individuals to purchase their medicine. I want to make a company where its goal is not to be money hungry, but to one day help humanity. There are multiple medicines out there that are not readily available for day to day individuals. There are people dying every single day because these companies only care about their money. Sometimes I wonder if the people who run these businesses have a single drop of humanity left in them. My goals seem a bit far fetched but I know I have the brain power to make it happen. Getting my biochemistry degree is only the first step into achieving my true goal. The only slight problem I have is paying for my degrees. My family isn’t the richest or the poorest but they cannot help me financially. They have given me everything they could have and I am extremely grateful. I cannot have gotten to the point I am at without them. They are why I am doing this in the first place. I want to give back to them at some point in my life. They deserve so much and I don’t know how I am going to repay them.<br><br>
        For the past three years of our lives, my parents and I have been building a house from scratch. During highschool I would struggle to keep my good grades due to having to work at our house. My life between these years have made it difficult to have a social life due to the construction of the house. When I wouldn’t be busy with schoolwork, I would be at the house helping my father in wherever I could. There were times where I would plug in headphones and listen to my school book when I worked. Even though I was balancing my schoolwork with the construction of the house, I was still able to graduate in a white gown and pass with a 4.1. To this day we still haven’t finished the construction of the house. We are at the edge of completion and my parents cannot be happier. We also have been living in the same small room for the past three years. Which has made it pretty hard to concentrate when living together with ten people. I am extremely grateful to my aunt for letting us stay at her house but doing classwork when my little cousins are screaming is not optimal for studying. All these bumps in the road are not stopping me from reaching my goals. They are helping me to prepare for future endeavors and when they do eventually come, I will be ready.
